I am working on this project to help people with the automation of the task of reading temperatures with DS18B20 probe on a Raspberry Pi 3

The prject is still in developpement yet but should be able in its final version to automatically detects the probes connected to the RPi, read the temperatures and eventually send an email (either an alert or a simple information, depending of the case) 

I am still a student so everything isn't perfect and any commentary or any help is galdly accepted of course

Cahier des charges :

- détecter le nombre de sondes
- lire les températures de chaque sondes
- envoyer un e-mail en cas d'alertes
